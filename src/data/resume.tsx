    // "At the end of 2022, I quit my job as a software engineer to go fulltime into building and scaling my own SaaS businesses. In the past, [I pursued a double degree in computer science and business](/#education), [interned at big tech companies in Silicon Valley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-LJ2e5qKdE), and [competed in over 21 hackathons for fun](/#hackathons). I also had the pleasure of being a part of the first ever in-person cohort of buildspace called [buildspace sf1](https://buildspace.so/sf1).",
    "Currenly, I am a senior at Temple University, and I am set to graduate May 2025 with a major in CS. When I'm not studying, you can find me indulging in one of my many interests. I play the piano üéπ and enjoy exploring music across genres. I speak three languages: English üá∫üá∏, Vietnamese üáªüá≥, and French üá´üá∑, which has helped me connect with people from diverse backgrounds. I also work as a part-time chef at a local restaurant in Philly. Additionally, I am a motorcycle racer üèçÔ∏è, and on sunny days, you will most likely find me at the track practicing or competing.",
